# Auto Updated Dashboard for IDX Stock Exchange

The dashboard is built with Streamlit, the candlestick is plotted with Plotly, and the model is created with Tensorflow.

The data is retrieved with yfinance library, so the data must be delayed for around 15 minutes from the real-time market data.

There will be some improvements, but for the general overview, here is the app link :
